## Introduction
Do you want to integrate ChatGPT into various chat platforms? This repository teaches you how to integrate it with Tinder so that you can automatically reply to messages and make new friends even when you're busy. The provided code structure only infers from past chat records, but engineers who can write code can also use users' background information, or even use image-related models to detect pictures, to enable ChatGPT to respond more appropriately.

## Explanation
- When does the bot reply?
    - The bot scans every five minutes and skips if there is no reply from the other party. If there is still no reply after one day, the bot will leave another message.
- How can I customize the settings?
    - In `main.py`, line 27 `scheduled_job` can be adjusted to change how often the bot replies.
    - In `main.py`, line 34 `for` can be adjusted to change how many conversations the bot responds to.
    - In `main.py`, line 47 `if` can be adjusted to change the conditions for when the bot responds to messages.
- How can I add more information?
    - In `/src/dialog.py`, there is a prefix that can be used to add information such as your preferred response style, so the bot can respond in accordance with your style.
